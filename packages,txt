## 🔧 What packages.txt Does:

Streamlit Cloud will install these system packages:
- **freetds-dev** - FreeTDS library for SQL Server
- **freetds-bin** - FreeTDS binaries
- **unixodbc** - ODBC driver manager
- **unixodbc-dev** - ODBC development files

These provide the ODBC drivers needed to connect to Azure SQL!

## ⏳ After Upload:

1. Streamlit Cloud will **rebuild** the app (takes 2-3 minutes)
2. It will install the system packages
3. FreeTDS driver will be available
4. Connection should work! 🎉
